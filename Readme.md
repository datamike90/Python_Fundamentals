#Python Fundamentals

This is my first Github repository. I am in the process of learning Python and I want to apply what I see in courses and tutorials. For this reason, I share some of the projects that I am making with Python fundamentals.

##Guess the Number

1. I start by importing the random module in my Python script.
2. I create a variable called "answer" that stores a random number generated by the randint function of the random module.
3. I use a while loop to allow the user to guess the number. Inside the loop, I ask the user to enter a number and store it in a variable called "guess".
4. I use an if statement to compare guess with answer. If they are equal, I print a congratulations message and break the loop. If guess is greater or less than answer, I print a message indicating if the guessed number is greater or less than the correct number and ask for a number again.
5. I add a counter to keep track of the attempts and show it to the user
6. I add an option for the user to exit the game.

´´´python

import random

answer = random.randint(1, 100)
guess = None
tries = 0

while guess != answer:
    guess = int(input("Adivina el número de 1 a 100: "))
    tries += 1
    if guess < answer:
        print("El número es mayor")
    elif guess > answer:
        print("El número es menor")
    else:
        print("Bien hecho! Adivinaste el número {} intentos.".format(tries))
